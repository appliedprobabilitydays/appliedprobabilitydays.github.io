### Applied Probability Day (1992-2003)

Applied Probability Day (APD) first took place in April 1992 at Columbia University as a one-day international event. It traditionally takes place on a Friday, 9:00AM - 6:00PM, leaving the weekend free for visitors to enjoy the many attractions of New York City.  In 1995 APD was merged together with the fall semester of Probability Towards 2000.
