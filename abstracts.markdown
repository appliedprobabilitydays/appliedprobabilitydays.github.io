*On the intersection between privacy, statistical inference, and optimality*

In this talk, I will give an overview and then a deeper dive on estimation under privacy constraints. Beginning from definitional aspects of privacy, I will transition to some of the tools my students, colleagues, and I have developed to provide various guarantees of optimality in estimation problems. These ideas will range from worst-case (minimax) bounds to more recent nuanced bounds that open the doors to instance optimality in private estimation, inspired by classical asymptotic and non-asymptotic notions of optimality. As part of our development, we will exhibit a complementary collection of estimators, including what we term the inverse sensitivity mechanisms, that exhibit various notions of optimality: minimax, instance, or others, for a large class of problems.

*Implementable coupling of a Lévy process and a Brownian motion*

We provide a simple algorithm for construction of Brownian paths approximating those of a Lévy process on a finite time interval. It requires knowledge of the Lévy process trajectory on a chosen regular grid and the law of its endpoint, or the ability to simulate from that. This algorithm is based on reordering of Brownian increments, and it can be applied in a recursive manner. We establish an upper bound on the mean squared maximal distance between the paths and determine a suitable mesh size in various asymptotic regimes. The analysis proceeds by reduction to the comonotonic coupling of increments. Applications to model risk and multilevel Monte Carlo are discussed in detail, and numerical examples are provided.\

*Conditional independence in max-linear Bayesian networks: impact graphs, source graphs, and &#65121;-dependence*

Motivated by extreme risk analysis, max-linear graphical models have been introduced and studied with the goal to follow extreme events spreading through a network. This is quite different to to classical graphical models, where the focus is on dependence around the mean of data. We present max-linear models naturally in the framework of tropical geometry. This perspective allows us to shed light on some known results and to prove others with algebraic techniques. In particular, we give a complete description of conditional independence relations for max-linear Bayesian networks. \

*Larger firms pay more in the gig economy*

If gig economy firms enjoy such powerful network effects, then why are such markets typically highly contestable and not dominated by large firms? We propose a theory showing that a shared pool of labor utilized by multiple firms creates diseconomies of scale at equilibrium. Specifically, smaller firms can free-ride on the shared labor pool that is maintained by larger firms that pay workers more in equilibrium. At the same time, our theory also shows that large firms are necessary for gig economies to form. These results provide important insights on the unique economics of the gig economy.\
